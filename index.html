<h1>HTML+CSS & Marks+Channels</h1>


    <div id="div1" class="container">
        <img src="bubble_and_pie_chart.jpg" alt="Chart" />
        <p>The mark used in this chart is area. Marks are therefore being used as items/nodes. In terms of channels, color and tilt have been used. </p>
    </div>

    <br>


    <div id="div1" class="container">
        <img src="stacked_bar_chart.jpg" alt="Chart" />
        <p>In terms of marks, lines have been used. The bars represent thick lines. In terms of channels, both the horizontal and vertical positions and colors have been used given that the unique position of each stack communicates a quantitative (X) and qualitative (Y) variable. In this case, the mark is also an item/node. </p>

    </div>

    <div id="div1" class="container">
        <img src="mind_map.jpg" alt="Chart" />
        <p>In terms of marks, points and lines have been utilized. Given that this is a mind map, the marks in this visualization are links. In terms of channels, color has been utilized to differentiate between the big image (theme) and smaller ideas.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="div1" class="container">
        <img src="bump_chart.jpg" alt="Chart" />
        <p> For this visualization, once again marks are represented as points and lines. therefore, marks are represented as links here just as we saw in the previous visualization. In terms of channels, color and both positions (vertical and horizontal) are used. Tilt is also implemented to map trajectory. </p>
